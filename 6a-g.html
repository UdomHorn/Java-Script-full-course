    //6a. Create a variable called 'hour' and save the current hour of the day(use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23).
    //-if hour is between 6 and 12, display 'Good morning!'in the console
    //-if hour is between 13 and 17, display 'Good afternoon!' in the console 
    //Otherwise, display 'Good night' in the console
    //6b. Continuing from 6a, try changeing the value in the 'hour' variable to make it display different messages.
    //6c. Continuing from 6a, create a variable called 'name'and save your name  inside (as a string). Update the if-statemet to display your name in each message. For example: 'Good morning ${name}!'

//6d. Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6years and younger) or seniors (65years and older).
//-Create a variable 'age' and save a person's age inside.
//-Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. if htey do, display 'Discount'in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.
//Note: try use the || operator in your solution.
// Try changing theh 'age' variable to display different messages.

//6e. Continuing from exercise 6d, let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHOliday = true;
//.Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.
//.Note && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets() to control which code gets done first.
//Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.
