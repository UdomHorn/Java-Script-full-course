    //8a. Let's say in the Amazon project, we have a basketball product. This product has a name of 'basketball', a price of 2095 cents. Create an object to represent this product and display it in the console.

    //8b. continuing from 8a, let's say we want to increase the price by 500 cents. Use dot notation to increase the price, and display the updated object in the console.

    //8c. Using bracket notation, add a property 'dellivery-time' to the object with the value '3 days'. Display the updated object in the console.
    
    Amazon = {
      basketeball: 'basketeball',
      price: '2095',
      'delivery-time':'3 days'
    };
    console.log(Amazon.basketeball);
    console.log(Amazon.price);

   Amazon.price='2595';
   console.log(Amazon.price);
   console.log(Amazon['delivery-time']);
